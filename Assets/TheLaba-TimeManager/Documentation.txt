How it works:
with the scirpt GlobalTimeManager and the UI in the example scene you can manage the global time in the project for all objects.
with the AreaTime and ObjectTime you can manage the single navmesh agents.
The Grenade script is an example to move the rigidBodyes.
Use the flycam script to move around the scene. 
To control the single navmesh agents you can use the CamRaycast script that through the raycast it open the single agents control.
